# Game Theory
Here, I plan to document my exploration with game theory - a subject and problem solving that I find quite enjoyable.

So far, here are the problems I have tried implementing: 

1. Prisoner's dilemma
2. The Monty Hall problem
3. Simple chess scenario
4. Bargaining scenarios
5. Bargaining under uncertainty!
